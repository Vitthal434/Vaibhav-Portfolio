<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Vaibhav Pandey, a passionate Computer Engineering student and aspiring software developer based in India. I enjoy building websites and apps that are simple, functional, and user-friendly.</p>

<p>I work with C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I’m currently learning more about backend development and database systems.</p>

<p>I love tackling challenging problems and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs and exploring new tools.</p>

<p>I’m open to internships, freelance projects, or just interesting conversations — feel free to get in touch!</p>
